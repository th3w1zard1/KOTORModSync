Welcome to KOTORModSync. Here are some things to know right off the bat:
- 'Raw Edit': Changes made in this mode are NOT automatically saved. You need to press 'Apply Editor Changes' to save your modifications.
- 'GUI Edit': This mode allows you to directly modify mod fields. When you change the text in a textbox, it immediately applies the changes to memory. However, the update may not be visible until you click away from the textbox, which may cause the screen to scroll to a different position.
- Refreshing in 'GUI Edit': To force a refresh, simply double-click on the component you are editing on the left. This will also update the 'Raw Edit' section with the latest information.
- Loading the Editor: Double-click on an item from the left.
- Variable Replacement in 'GUI Edit': The 'GUI Edit' mode automatically replaces directories with the variables <<kotorDirectory>> and <<modDirectory>>. These directories are set up using the 'Set Directories' button. If you do not see the variables automatically replaced and still see paths like C:\User***\Documents, it means you either need to refresh your component or set up the directories correctly. You can check the output window for more information.
- Removing/adding instructions, dependencies, and restrictions are currently restricted to the Raw editor. Use the GUI editor to fine-tune them.

General usage:
Each mod needs at least three things:
- A name
- A Global Unique Identifier (GUID)
- Some instructions.
Everything else is optional (most of it is for docs).


Additional Points to Note:
- When you create a new mod using the 'Add Mod' button, example data is filled into the 'Raw Edit' section. Remember to press 'Apply Editor Changes' before proceeding, otherwise the example data will not be used and will not be available in the 'GUI Edit' section.
- Every time you press 'refresh tree view' it'll create a backup. It'll create arbitrary backups for nearly every action. Preventing data loss is important to me, but we'll of course remove this in a later release.
- Some instructions may have properties like 'destination' or 'overwrite' that may not make sense for certain actions like 'run', 'tslpatcher', or 'extract'. These properties are ONLY used for the 'move' and 'delete' actions. You can ignore them for other actions as they won't be used.
- When extracting an archive, all contents will be extracted to a new folder in your <<modDirectory>>. The folder will be named after the archive itself. For example, if you extract 'this_mod_archive.rar', it will create a folder named 'this_mod_archive' automatically inside the <<modDirectory>>. The 'Source' property for the move/delete command will look like ["<<modDirectory>>/this_mod_archive"].
- When using the browse for files buttons, you'll want to set your directories first so that the paths have the correct <<modDirectory>> and <<kotorDirectory>> environment variables, respectively.

Installing Mods:
The installer is designed to install the Snigaroo mod build according to predefined instructions. In most cases, these instructions are fixed and do not require any customization. However, for approximately 10% of mods that have flexible dependencies, the installer will run default or recommended instructions. You will need to change the config to customize anything prior to an install.
